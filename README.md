# Tasks

## 0. README and objectives!
mandatory

In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

- Page in Figma
- fig file

And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing 'README.md'


## 1. Header
mandatory

Let’s start by the top: **the header**

Here the wireframe of it:

- Create the HTML skeleton ('html', 'head', 'body', etc.)
- In the body, add an 'header' tag
- Inside this header:
  + Add a link element with an image inside
  + Add a block of 3 link elements

## 2. Banner
mandatory

Now, the banner under the `header`:

Under the `header`, add a `main` element with inside a `section` element.

In this `section` element, add:

- A block with inside:
     + An heading tag (don’t forget to use the correct heading value)
     + A text element
     + A button tag
- Another block with inside:
     + Another heading tag (same, be careful about which one you are using)
     + A block containing 4 blocks - each block with inside:
          - An image
          - An heading tag
          - A text


## 3. Quote
mandatory

Under the banner, we will add the quote block:

The quote section is inside the `main`:

- Create a new section for the quote
- Inside, add a block containing:
     + An image
     + Another block with inside:
          - A quote tag
          - An author quote
          - A text


## 4. Videos
mandatory

Let’s now add the videos list:

New `section` with inside:

- An heading tag
- A block containing the 4 video block - each of them are composed with:
     + An image
     + An heading
     + A text
     + A block for the author:
         - A image
         - An heading
     + A block for the rating:
         - A block of images (one star = one image)
         - A text


## 5. Membership
mandatory

Membership section is similar as the videos list:

After the videos list section, add a new`section` containing:

   - An heading
   - A block with inside 4 block item - each block defined with:
     + An image
     + An heading
     + A text
   - A button


6. FAQ
mandatory

The FAQ section is ending the page before the footer:

Add a `section` for the FAQ with inside:

- A block that contains 2 “row block”
- Each “row block” contains 2 “item block”
- Each “item block” is composed of:
   + An heading
   + A text


## 7. Footer
mandatory

And… the footer!

After the last `section`, outside of the `main`, add a `footer`:

- A global block (used later for centering the footer content), inside this block:
     + A “row block” with:
          - An image
          - A block with inside:
               - Images with link
     + A text

And… that’s it for the moment - the result should not be shiny, don’t worry, CSS is coming…
